* SETUP

Create a system user for the application:

sudo adduser medley --system --ingroup proxy --home /srv/medley

The user is added to the proxy group because so that it can interact with pdnsd.

The adduser command will warn that the specified home directory does not belong to the user being created, but ignore that.

Copy the file init to /etc/init.d/medley and then run

sudo update-rc.d medley defaults

If medley located somewhere other than /srv/medley, edit the paths in the init file accordingly.
