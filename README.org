* Medley

A collection of lightweight, single-purpose web applications that are too
small or trivial to bother making standalone.

Medley is written in Python 3 and uses the CherryPy framework.

* Setup

You'll need at least Python 3.4. Then:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:lovett/medley.git
cd medley
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
make setup
make serve
#+end_src

* Testing

~make test~ will run through all tests for all apps.

~make [appname]~ will run through the tests for a specific app.

~make htmlcov~ will generate a coverage report in HTML

~make coverage~ will print a coverage report to the console.
